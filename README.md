### **Clustered Mouse Track**

Clustered Mouse Track is an application that demonstrates parallel processing in Node.js. Tracking mouse activity can be a very intense task, so the workload is divided based on the amount of clients. Each client has its own separate CPU core. 

To do:
1. Open http://example.com/admin
2. This should lead you to a blank light-green page.
3. Open http://example.com/ on a separate browser
4. A graph with mouse activity of the browser from step. 3 should be displayed
5. Open http://example.com/ to view more graphs being displayed


While the primary purpose of this project was to learn Node.js Cluster Module & PM2, I learned how to create graphs with d3.js and used real-time protocols such as WebSockets.
